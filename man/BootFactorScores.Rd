\section{Technicalities}{

The input of \code{BootFactorScores} is obtained from the
\code{distatis} function, the output is a 3-way array
of dimensions number
of observations by number of factors by number of replicates.
The output is
typically used to plot confidence intervals
(i.e., ellipsoids or convex
hulls) or to compute \eqn{t}-like statistic
called \emph{bootstrap ratios}.
To compute a bootstrapped sample a set of
\eqn{K} distance matrices is
selected with replacement from the original set of \eqn{K} distance
matrices.
The partial factors scores of the selected distance matrices are
then averaged to produce the bootstrapped estimate
of the factor scores of
the observations.
This approach is also called \emph{partial boostrap} by
Lebart (2007, see also Chateau & Lebart 1996).
It has the advantage of
being very fast even for very large data sets.
Recent work (Cadoret & Husson,
2012), however, suggests that partial boostrap could lead
to optimistic
bootstrap estimates when the number of distance matrices
is large and that
it is preferable to use instead a \emph{total boostrap}
approach (i.e.,
creating new compromises by
resampling and then projecting them on the
common solution see function
\code{BootFromCompromise}, and Cadoret &
Husson, 2012 see also Abdi \emph{et al}., 2009 for an example).

\examples{
# 1. Load the Sort data set from the SortingBeer example
#    (available from the DistatisR package)
data(SortingBeer)
# Provide an 8 beers by 10 assessors set of
# results of a sorting task
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Create the set of distance matrices (one distance matrix per assessor)
#    (ues the function DistanceFromSort)
DistanceCube <- DistanceFromSort(Sort)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Call the DISTATIS routine with the cube of distance as parameter
testDistatis <- distatis(DistanceCube)
# The factor scores for the beers are in
# testDistatis$res4Splus$F
# the partial factor score for the beers for the assessors are in
#  testDistatis$res4Splus$PartialF
#
# 4. Get the bootstraped factor scores (with default 1000 iterations)
BootF <- BootFactorScores(testDistatis$res4Splus$PartialF)
