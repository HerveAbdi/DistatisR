\title{Metric (classical) Multidimensional Scaling
(a.k.a Principal Coordinate
Analysis) of a (Euclidean) Distance Matrix.}
\usage{
mmds(DistanceMatrix, masses = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{DistanceMatrix}{A squared (assumed to be Euclidean)
distance matrix}

\item{masses}{A vector of masses
(i.e., a set of non-negative numbers with a sum of
1) of same dimensionality as the number
of rows of \code{DistanceMatrix}.}
}
\value{
Sends back a list \item{LeF}{factor scores for the objects.}
\item{eigenvalues}{the eigenvalues for the factor scores
 (i.e., a variance).}
\item{tau}{the percentage of explained variance by each dimension.}
\item{Contributions}{give the proporion of explained
variance by an object
for a dimension.}
}
\description{
\code{mmds}: Perform a Metric Multidimensional Scaling
(MMDS) of an (Euclidean) distance matrix measured between a set of
objects (with or without masses).
}
\details{
\code{mmds} gives factor scores that make it possible
to draw a map of the objects
such that the distances between objects
on the map best approximate the
original distances between objects.
}
\section{Method}{
 MMDS transform the distance matrix
into a (double centered)
covariance-like matrix which is then analyzed
via its eigen-decomposition.  The
factor scores of each dimension are scaled
such that their variance (i.e.,
the sum ot their weighted squared factor scores)
is equal to the eigen-value
of the corresponding dimension.
 Note that if the \code{masses} vector is
absent, equal masses
(i.e., 1 divided by number of objects) are used.
}

\section{Technicalities}{

the distance matrix to be analyzed is supposed to be a
\eqn{squared} euclidean distance matrix.
Note also that a non Euclidean distance matrix
will have negative eigenvalues that will be ignored
by \code{mmds} which, therefore, gives the best Euclidean
approximation to this non-Euclidean distance matrix
(note that, nonmetric MDS maybe a better technique in these cases).

# the eigenvalues of mmds are equal to \Lambda *{1/nrow(D)}
# (ie., the normalization differs but the results are proportional)
