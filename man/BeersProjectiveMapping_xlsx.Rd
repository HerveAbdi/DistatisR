\description{
\code{BeersProjectiveMapping_xlsx}:
an example of an excel file
with Projective Mapping and vocabulary. 
This excel file can be read by
\code{read.df.excel}. In this example
7 (fictitious) assessors evaluated 7 Beers.
}
\details{
In this example of projective mapping with vocabulary,
7 (fictitious) assessors evaluated 7 Beers 
First, each assessor positionned the 7 beers on a sheet
of paper according  to the perceived similarity between the beers.
For each assessor, the position of the beers is recorded
from the \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} coordinates. 
Second, the assessors are asked if they can describe the
beers with some freely chosen descriptors. These descriptors
are stored in a list with 7 elements (one per assessor)
where each element of the list
is a 7 component vector (one per beer) where each element stores
the words used to describe a beer 
(words are separated with spaces).
The coordinates of the beers on the sheet of paper
are stored in the sheet \code{Maps}, the Vocabulary generated
by the assessors is stored in the sheet
\code{Vocabulary}
